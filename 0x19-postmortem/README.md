Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:

The root cause was a conflict between a recently updated plugin and the WordPress core files. The plugin introduced changes that were incompatible with the current WordPress version, leading to a fatal error and resulting in the Error 500.
Resolution:

The resolution involved deactivating the problematic plugin. Once deactivated, the site was able to function correctly. Further investigation revealed that the plugin update included a deprecated function call that was not supported by the current WordPress core files.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Plugin Compatibility Checks: Implement a more rigorous compatibility check process before updating plugins.
Staging Environment: Ensure all updates are first tested in a staging environment to catch issues before they affect the live site.
Automated Monitoring: Enhance monitoring to detect specific plugin-related errors and provide more detailed alerts.
Developer Training: Conduct training sessions for developers on best practices for plugin updates and error handling.
Task List:

Patch the Affected Plugin: Work with the plugin developer to patch the plugin and resolve compatibility issues.
Update Monitoring Tools: Add monitoring for specific error codes related to plugin issues.
Create Staging Environment: Set up a staging environment for testing updates before deploying them to the live site.
Develop Rollback Procedures: Implement procedures to quickly roll back problematic updates.
Audit Other Plugins: Conduct an audit of all installed plugins to ensure compatibility with the current WordPress version.
Improve Error Logging: Enhance error logging to provide more detailed information in the event of future issues.
By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar outages in the future and ensure a more robust and reliable WordPress site for our users.
