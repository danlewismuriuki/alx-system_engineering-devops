# Load Balancer

This repository contains code and configuration files for a custom load balancer solution. Load balancing is a critical component of distributed systems architecture, enabling efficient distribution of incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers.

## Overview

A load balancer acts as an intermediary between clients and backend servers, distributing client requests across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization, high availability, and improved performance. This repository provides a custom load balancer implementation built using [technology/framework/language].

## Features

- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Automatically distributes incoming traffic across backend servers based on predefined algorithms such as round-robin, least connections, or weighted distribution.
- **Health Checking**: Monitors the health of backend servers and removes or re-routes traffic from unhealthy servers to maintain system reliability and availability.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Allows customization of load balancing algorithms, server weights, and health check parameters to suit specific application requirements.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Provides logging and monitoring capabilities to track traffic patterns, server performance, and system health metrics.
- **Scalability**: Supports horizontal scaling by adding or removing backend servers dynamically to accommodate fluctuating traffic loads.
