# Bash Scripting and API Concepts

## What Bash Scripting Should Not Be Used For
Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in Unix-based systems. However, it has its limitations and should not be used for:
- Complex data processing: Use a programming language like Python or Perl instead.
- GUI applications: Bash is not suitable for creating graphical user interfaces.
- High-performance computing: For performance-critical applications, use languages like C or C++.
- Cross-platform applications: Bash scripts are primarily for Unix-based systems and may not run on other operating systems without modification.

## What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications use to request and exchange data.

## What is a REST API?
A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of API that conforms to the principles of REST, an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request.

## What are Microservices?
Microservices are an architectural style where an application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over a network. Each microservice is responsible for a specific functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This approach allows for greater flexibility and scalability in application development.

## What is the CSV Format?
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. Each line in a CSV file represents a record, and each record consists of fields separated by commas. 

## What is the JSON Format?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is text-based and uses a collection of key/value pairs and ordered lists of values.

## Pythonic Package and Module Name Style
- **Package and Module Names**: Should be short, lowercase names. Use underscores if necessary to improve readability.
  - Example: `my_package`, `my_module`

## Pythonic Class Name Style
- **Class Names**: Should follow the CapWords convention (also known as CamelCase), where each word starts with an uppercase letter.
  - Example: `MyClass`, `EmployeeRecord`

## Pythonic Variable Name Style
- **Variable Names**: Should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores to improve readability.
  - Example: `my_variable`, `employee_name`

## Pythonic Function Name Style
- **Function Names**: Should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores to improve readability.
  - Example: `my_function()`, `calculate_total()`

## Pythonic Constant Name Style
- **Constant Names**: Should be all uppercase, with words separated by underscores.
  - Example: `MY_CONSTANT`, `MAX_LIMIT`

## Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python
CapWords (CamelCase) is a naming convention in Python where each word in a compound word starts with an uppercase letter, without spaces or underscores. This convention is primarily used for class names and helps distinguish classes from functions and variables. It improves code readability and helps maintain a consistent coding style.
